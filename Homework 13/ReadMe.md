FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL
    For my final project for Creative Coding I want to make a simple snake style game. I've been playing snake on Google when I get bored, so I figured why not try to recreate it for my final. I think it'll be fun if it's made from simple shapes, so instead of snake it'll be more like "worm" and the food it eats will be brown to immitate dirt. 

    I know I'll need to get better at understanding if/else statments to make the game work, and I'm sure there are more functions I'll need to learn in order to make it work the way I want it to. Like how to make the game end when the worm hits the edge of the screen. And how to make the food disappear and appear somewhere else when the worm eats it. And how to make the worm get longer the more food it eats, and see if I can make the game end when the worm runs into itself. 


WORK TIMELINE
    4/22 - 4/25: Set up the background for the game by making a grid and make the background color green. Make the rectangle that the worm is going to start out as pink, figure out how to make the worm move with wasd and have the body turn. 

    4/28 - 5/02: Add the "dirt" to the grid to act as the food that will make the worm longer. Figure out how to make it disappear when the worm interacts with it, and then reappear in a different location. Figure out how to make the worm grow one square longer when it collides with the food.

    5/05 - 5/09: Make the game end when the worm collides with itself or the wall, create a "GAME OVER" screen, add a score counter for the amount of dirt eaten. Spend any extra time trouble shooting how to make my github live site link work so that the game can operate as a website and not just through p5.js.org 

WORK DONE SO FAR
    So far I've found a video to reference that will hopefully help me troubleshoot issues if I get stuck and I've also started making the background and grid. In the next couple of days I'm going to work on making the worm function before it starts growing, which I think will end up being one of the trickiest parts of my project.
